# Social Media Post Recommendation Algorithm Research

This repository is an experimental space for developing and testing recommendation algorithms that prioritize **social benefits** over traditional metrics like engagement, profit, or traffic. Unlike prior work focused solely on ranking, this project explores how to recommend a set of posts for a given social media post, with the goal of amplifying content that helps humanity.

## Purpose

Current social media platforms optimize for metrics that maximize user attention and platform revenue, often at the expense of user wellbeing and societal health. This project extends previous ranking research by focusing on recommendation: selecting a small set of posts to suggest alongside a given post, based on their potential to promote constructive discourse, well-being, and positive social impact.

Key objectives include:

- Recommending posts that foster meaningful interactions and community building
- Reducing the spread of misinformation and harmful content
- Encouraging diverse perspectives and reducing echo chambers
- Supporting mental health and positive user experiences
- Promoting content with long-term social value

## What's Inside

This repository contains prompts, LLM responses, and research artifacts related to developing recommendation algorithms with a social-first approach. The goal is to prototype and evaluate systems that select and score recommended content for its value to society, not just engagement.

## Approach

Rather than optimizing for clicks, likes, or time-on-platform, we're exploring recommendation factors that could include:

- Content accuracy and factual reliability
- Constructive vs. divisive communication patterns
- Educational or informational value
- Community building potential
- Long-term user satisfaction and wellbeing
- Alignment with the "help humanity" objective

## Status

This is an active research project. Ideas, contributions, and discussions are welcome as we explore how technology can better serve human flourishing through recommendation, not just ranking.
