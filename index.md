# Social Media Recommendation Algorithm Research

This repository is an experimental space for developing and testing recommendation algorithms that prioritize **social benefits** over traditional metrics like engagement, profit, or traffic. Building on previous work in ranking, this project explores how to recommend a set of posts for a given social media post, amplifying content that helps humanity.

## The Challenge

Below is the main prompt being used to explore how we might design recommendation algorithms that help humanity rather than maximize engagement:

## Model Responses

Below is a response from a large language model to the above prompt:

### Resources
- [Project GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pbutland/recommendation-algorithm)

## Purpose

Current social media platforms optimize for metrics that maximize user attention and platform revenue, often at the expense of user wellbeing and societal health. This project extends the ranking philosophy to recommendation: selecting a small set of posts to suggest alongside a given post, based on their potential to promote constructive discourse, well-being, and positive social impact.

Key objectives include:
- Recommending posts that foster meaningful interactions and community building
- Reducing the spread of misinformation and harmful content
- Encouraging diverse perspectives and reducing echo chambers
- Supporting mental health and positive user experiences
- Promoting content with long-term social value

## Status

This is an active research project exploring how technology can better serve human flourishing through recommendation, not just ranking.
