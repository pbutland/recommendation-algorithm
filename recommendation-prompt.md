# Design Challenge: Social Media Post Recommendation Algorithm for Humanity's Benefit

In recent years, social media platforms have primarily used recommendation algorithms to maximize user engagement, often at the expense of broader societal well-being. This has shaped not only what content individuals see, but also the collective discourse and values of society. You are tasked with designing a social media post recommendation algorithm that, given the content of a single post and a large set of ranked posts, selects approximately 5 new posts to recommend—prioritizing those that have the greatest potential to "help humanity" rather than simply maximizing engagement or platform metrics.

## Required output

- A discussion of whether both ranking and recommendation scoring are necessary, or if one approach could suffice for the goal of helping humanity.
- Detailed suggestions on how to select and recommend posts based on the "help humanity" objective. Include examples of content that would be recommended, content that would not, and how ambiguous or borderline cases might be handled. What would a "scoring" mechanism look like?
- Suggestions for implementing such a recommendation algorithm in real-world scenarios (e.g., as part of an existing platform, as a cross-platform "meta" recommender, or within open-architecture platforms).
- An explanation of how the algorithm could "learn" and improve its recommendations over time. What feedback signals or metrics would indicate positive or negative impact?
- Considerations for self-correction and adaptability, given the subjective and evolving nature of "helping humanity." Propose mechanisms for updating the algorithm’s goals, incorporating human input, and defending against gaming or manipulation by bad actors.
- Any other suggestions or considerations relevant to this challenge.
- A conclusion summarizing the key points and reflecting on the broader implications of such a recommendation system.
